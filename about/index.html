<h1 id="1983-a-tale-of-two-worlds">1983: A Tale of Two Worlds</h1>
<p>It was 1983, a time of technological wonder when the seeds of the digital revolution were sown. Two years later, in November 1985, Microsoft, a company that would become a software behemoth, released Windows 1.0. This groundbreaking operating system began a new era in personal computing, transforming how people interacted with technology. Meanwhile, halfway across the world, I was born in a remote village in Pakistan, untouched by the burgeoning digital wave yet rich in its tapestry of life.</p>
<p>My early days were spent in the lap of a village that boasted fertile soil and diverse green lands, nestled gently in a series of modest mountains. While not as imposing as the towering peaks of northern Pakistan, these mountains provided a friendly terrain for a leisurely hour-long climb. They were a stark contrast to the world of personal computers and software unfolding elsewhere, yet they held their charm and history.</p>
<p>As a child, I fondly recall wandering with my dog through these mountains, which once served as the capital of Buddhism in the 1st century AD. These walks were more than just physical excursions; they were journeys through time, where each step resonated with centuries of history and culture. In the calm of these hills, far from the burgeoning digital world, my story began – a tale of two worlds, one rooted deeply in rich heritage and the other destined to intertwine with the rapidly evolving realm of technology.</p>
<h1 id="1992-national-triumphs-personal-journeys">1992: National Triumphs, Personal Journeys</h1>
<p>As the world continued its rapid technological march between 1983 and 1992, witnessing the rise of the internet and the proliferation of personal computing, a different kind of celebration was unfolding in Pakistan. In 1992, the country was basking in the glory of being champions in not just one but several sports. cricket, hockey, squash, and snooker – Pakistan dominated these arenas, instilling a sense of pride and unity across the nation.</p>
<p>That same year, my family made a significant journey back to our ancestral village from the industrial city of Abbottabad. This return to our roots, where our ancestors had lived for over four centuries, marked a new chapter in my life. With its timeless charm and simplicity, the village stood in stark contrast to the buzzing industrial life we had known.</p>
<p>At 8, I remember 1992 as a year of joy and discovery. It was not just about returning to the village but also about embracing the rich linguistic heritage of our region. I started picking up Arabic, Urdu, Pashto, and Hindko, languages that painted the cultural canvas of our community. English was yet to make its appearance in my linguistic journey. During our time away from the village, I had also embraced sports, learning cricket, hockey, badminton, and football. These sports were more than just games; they reflected the national spirit, echoing the country’s triumphs in various international arenas.</p>
<h1 id="1994-my-digital-odyssey-begins">1994: My Digital Odyssey Begins</h1>
<p>In 1994, a significant chapter in my life unfolded as I was enrolled in a newly established private primary school, a pioneer in promoting early computer education alongside english literature. The school was a marvel of its time, boasting a state-of-the-art computer lab, exceptional teachers, an english medium curriculum, and an extraordinarily vibrant art department. It was a place where traditional learning met the cutting edge of technology, creating an environment ripe for intellectual and creative exploration.</p>
<p>My fascination with computers began in the corridors of that computer lab. I was captivated by the magic of computing, diligently practising keyboard commands, repeating them thousands of times with unwavering dedication. Whenever I needed a break from this rigorous practice, I found solace in an old floppy disk that contained the Prince of Persia game. This game wasn’t just a source of entertainment; it was a window into a world of digital wonder, a world that captivated my young mind.</p>
<p>My curiosity wasn’t limited to software; I was equally intrigued by the hardware aspect of computers. I often disassemble and reassemble computers, turning this hobby into a freelance computer hardware repair venture, even during my primary school years. But at heart, I was a software boy, and it wasn’t long before I stumbled upon what would become a lifelong passion – software code. This early exposure to both the hardware and software realms of computing was the foundation for my future in the tech world.</p>
<h1 id="1995-entering-the-world-of-internet-wonders">1995: Entering the World of Internet Wonders</h1>
<p>In 1995, my technological journey took a significant leap forward. My fascination with computer hardware had given me a robust understanding of the components that breathed life into these machines. Yet, as I delved deeper, my interests evolved, pushing me towards new digital horizons.</p>
<p>This was the year when the allure of hardware gave way to the boundless possibilities of the internet. In the same computer lab where I had pieced together countless machines, I discovered a portal to the world beyond – the internet. It was a realm that extended far past the physical confines of my village, opening doors to global communication and information.</p>
<p>Amidst this digital exploration, a new passion began to take root – digital products. The internet was not just a network of information but a canvas for creativity. The idea of putting my mark on this vast digital expanse was exhilarating. I was captivated by the prospect of sharing my photos and creations online, transforming them from personal memories into accessible digital artefacts. This early venture into cloud computing marked the beginning of a profound affinity for the digital world, setting the stage for a future deeply intertwined with the ever-evolving landscape of the internet.</p>
<h1 id="1999-2001-the-college-days">1999-2001: The College Days</h1>
<p>Between 1999 and 2001, my life was divided into three parts. I played cricket during college hours, attended tech social gatherings in the afternoons, and engaged with global communities on digital forums in the evenings. This routine became my rhythm, a balance of physical activity, local interaction, and global digital exploration.</p>
<p>I regretted being distracted by hobbies and digital engagement during college. My academic performance suffered, but I still managed to secure a place at university to study software engineering. It was a bittersweet realisation that passions can lead us away from traditional paths.</p>
<p>I made friends from around the world through my digital ventures, where we shared coding solutions, and I pursued my creative side as a DJ. These experiences helped me develop my technical skills and build global connections.</p>
<h1 id="2002-2006-the-university-years">2002-2006: The University Years</h1>
<p>From 2002 to 2006, I studied computer and information technology at university. I focused on software engineering, hardware, and digital technology and excelled in my studies with 25 A+ grades and over 90% in most subjects.</p>
<p>Before university, I was already gearing up for the tech battleground. I was the classroom maverick, playfully challenging teachers and stirring lessons with sharp-witted humour. A paradoxical mix of a back-bencher, a social butterfly, and a reserved observer, I was honing my skills for the bigger game.</p>
<p>After my studies, I freelanced in coding, tech training, and digital publishing. I got two job offers before graduation and chose to work in Jeddah, Saudi Arabia, where my parents have lived since 1993, to establish myself in the tech industry.</p>
<h1 id="2007-2008-the-united-kingdom">2007-2008: The United Kingdom</h1>
<p>In 2007, I pursued higher education in technology in the UK. Initially, I enrolled for an MSc in computer animation but later shifted to an MSc in computing and the Internet at the University of Bedfordshire before my Msc graudation.</p>
<p>As the creator of an online booking platform designed to convert digital visitors into paid customers, my master’s thesis manifested my passion for technology and industry.</p>
<p>I was appointed an e-commerce software engineer by the University of Bedfordshire, funded by the east of england development authority. I collaborated with a local transportation firm, was appointed as a cto, and later became a shareholder. This recognition marked a significant milestone in my professional journey.</p>

<h1 id="2009-2010-pioneering-ai-automation">2009-2010: Pioneering AI Automation</h1>
<p>I explored digital and commercial experimentation, automating human-driven tasks through AI. I used several programming frameworks to develop intricate AI solutions, transforming routine tasks into automated processes. This period reimagined daily operations in various industries through intelligent automation.</p>
<p>I spearheaded my ventures during this era, focusing on paid media buying, expert front-end sales funnel optimisation, and cutting-edge visualisation-based back-end software development. I applied my technical insight to refine and revolutionise the digital presence of various services, blending creativity and technical expertise to elevate the digital experience in the e-commerce and leisure industry.</p>
<p>I transformed paid media buying in the leisure sector by introducing cutting-edge copywriting techniques and sales funnel trends. My work redefined the sector’s online presence, setting new digital marketing and customer engagement standards.</p>
<h1 id="2011-2015-the-doctorate-years">2011-2015: The Doctorate Years</h1>
<p>2011, I began my doctoral research at the Institute of Applicable Computing at the University of Bedfordshire. After years of hard work and dedication, I defended my PhD in Information Visualisation and Data Analysis.</p>

<p>I flipped several software backend ventures on Flippa.com, including two UK Limited companies: a children’s furniture dropshipping e-commerce business(Kidzden) with a £100K/month turnover and Minicasp.com, a software company with a prestigious B2B client base in the UK and Republic of Ireland.</p>
<p>In the past five years, I earned a PhD and contributed as a tech consultant to various corporations. I co-founded multiple companies and helped steer existing businesses towards profitability.</p>
<p>I obtained academic funding from the University of Bournemouth and co-supervised PhD researchers while pursuing my interests in artificial intelligence, data analysis, consumer behaviour, cryptocurrency, and blockchain.</p>
<h1 id="the-blockchain-years">The Blockchain Years</h1>
<p>From 2016 to 2019, I achieved global recognition after completing my doctorate. This academic milestone wasn’t just a testament to my hard work; it was a transformative experience that changed me for the better.</p>
<p>It fueled my passion to share my journey with the world, leading me to traverse the globe, attending and speaking at numerous conferences. Each destination was an opportunity to recount the tales of perseverance and innovation that had sculpted my career.</p>
<p>In 2017, I co-founded the Global Blockchain Consortium (GBC) as a think tank for Blockchain and disruptive technologies. GBC attracted high-profile academics and industry experts, facilitating pivotal conversations and groundbreaking advancements in blockchain technology.</p>
<p>As a Blockchain CTO, I contributed to high-profile whitepapers and ICOs, developing smart contracts on Distributed Ledger Technology. My work was part of a movement reshaping the digital landscape.</p>
<p>During these years, I expanded my network, won business contracts, and founded Bengaged Media, a data-driven digital marketing company that assists blockchain-based innovations. My journey was a testament to the power of networking, collaboration, and digital transformation.</p>
<h1 id="2020-2022-the-pandemic-years">2020-2022: The Pandemic Years</h1>
<p>The pandemic years of 2020-2022 brought unprecedented challenges and opportunities for innovation. As a technologist in the leisure sector, I faced a significant impact. The industry’s standstill forced us to reevaluate and adjust our product lines and services. This period was about resilience and strategic pivoting in the face of adversity.</p>
<p>In these times, we expanded our reach and refocused our efforts. Our AI-powered products now enhance sales funnels and traffic. We established Takhtbhai.com offices for 200+ staff in Pakistan to focus on the MENA region, diversify our offerings, and achieve success.</p>

This initiative later became SwiftGrants and rndwithkhan.com, platforms dedicated to helping businesses navigate the complexities of R&amp;D funding.</p>
<p>My involvement in these efforts was a professional and personal mission, providing struggling businesses with a much-needed beacon of hope during one of the most challenging periods in recent history.</p>
<h1 id="2023-2024-ais-defining-era">2023-2024: AI&rsquo;s Defining Era</h1>
